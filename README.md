# Genetic Algorithm-Reinforcement Learning in Flappy Bird

In this project, we explore the use of a genetic algorithm combined with a neural network for reinforcement learning in the popular game Flappy Bird. The genetic algorithm is used to evolve a population of potential solutions (i.e. neural network weights and biases) over multiple generations, with the goal of maximizing the score achieved by each individual in the population. The neuron network, trained using the genetic algorithm, learns to play the game and reach the highest score possible through repeated trial and error. This approach allows the machine to self-learning and adapt to the game dynamics, ultimately achieving a high level of performance.
