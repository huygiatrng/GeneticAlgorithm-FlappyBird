# Flappy Bird AI using Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network

This project explores the use of a genetic algorithm combined with a neural network for reinforcement learning in the popular game Flappy Bird. The goal is to maximize the score achieved by each individual in the population by evolving neural network weights and biases over multiple generations. The neural network, trained using the genetic algorithm, learns to play the game and reach the highest score possible through repeated trial and error. This approach allows the machine to self-learn and adapt to the game dynamics, ultimately achieving a high level of performance.
